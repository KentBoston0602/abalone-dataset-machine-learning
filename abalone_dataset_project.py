    A Streamlit web application that performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **Data Preprocessing**, and **Supervised Machine Learning** to predict the age of abalone from physical measurements using **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest Regressor** and **Support Vector Regression**.

    #### Pages
    1. `Dataset` - The Abalone Dataset contains information about abalone, including its sex, length, diameter, height, whole weight, shucked weight, viscera weight, shell weight, and rings.
    2. `EDA` - Exploratory Data Analysis of the Abalone dataset. The analysis involved examining data both individually and in pairs. Histograms and pie charts were used to understand the distribution of numerical and categorical features, respectively. Pair plots and heatmaps were employed to visualize relationships and correlations between numerical features. Box plots were used to identify and potentially address outliers in the dataset.
    3. `Data Cleaning / Pre-processing` - Data cleaning and pre-processing steps such as encoding the 'Sex' column and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
    4. `Machine Learning` - Training three supervised ML models: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor and Support Vector Regression. Includes model evaluation, model prediction visualizations and feature importance.
    5. `Prediction` - Prediction page where users can input values to predict the age of abalone using the trained models.
    6. `Conclusion` - Summary of the insights and observations from the EDA and model training.

    The Abalone dataset was uploaded to UCI Machine Learning Repository. It is a dataset used widely in machine learning.

    From the original data, examples with missing values, primarily those with missing predicted values, were removed. The ranges of continuous values were scaled by dividing by 200 for use with an ANN.  

    For each sample, eight features are measured: Sex, Length, Diameter, Height, Whole weight, Shucked weight, Viscera weight, and Shell weight. This dataset is commonly used to test regression techniques to predict the Age of the abalone. The same dataset that is used for this data science activity was uploaded to Kaggle by the user named Rodolfo Mendes.

    **Content**  
    The dataset has 4177 rows containing 8 numeric attributes that are related to abalone, the columns are as follows: Sex, Length, Diameter, Height, Whole weight, Shucked weight, Viscera weight, Shell weight and Age.

    The Abalone dataset contains 4,177 entries with nine columns, where each column represents a feature of an abalone.

    2. **Length:** The longest shell measurement (in millimeters).
    3. **Diameter:** The shell measurement perpendicular to the length (in millimeters).
    4. **Height:** The height of the abalone with the meat included (in millimeters).
    5. **Whole weight:** The whole abalone‚Äôs weight (in grams).
    6. **Shucked weight:** The weight of the abalone's meat (in grams) after it has been removed from the shell.
    7. **Viscera weight:** The weight of the gut of the abalone after bleeding (in grams).
    8. **Shell weight:** The weight of the abalone‚Äôs dried shell (in grams).
